# The Root

**A public health journey. From zero to real wellness. For everyone.**

I’m starting this project because I’ve decided to go *all in* on my health. No more half-measures. No more guessing. I want to understand what truly supports the human body – and what silently poisons it.
This is my open notebook. My personal “bible.” My path. And anyone can read, learn, and contribute.

I’m not an expert. I’m starting from (almost) zero. But I’ll research, question, test, and document everything along the way – clearly, honestly, and practically.

This isn’t about perfect routines, expensive gadgets, or strict diets. It’s about the stuff that really matters in daily life:
What we eat, what we put on our skin, how we move, how we sleep, and what we expose ourselves to. The everyday decisions that shape our long-term health.

### What you’ll find here:

* **Food:** sugar, seed oils, processed food, tap water, caffeine, supplements, fasting, real nourishment
* **Movement:** low-intensity vs. high-intensity, walking, swimming, strength, longevity > burnout
* **Mind:** light exposure, blue light, sleep, dopamine, overstimulation, digital detox
* **Body:** skincare, deodorant, sunscreen, toothpaste – without toxins or microplastics
* **Home:** cleaning products, air quality, EMFs, mold, hormone disruptors, filtered water
* **Science:** how to read studies, detect bias, understand conflicts of interest, filter wellness BS
* **Plus:** alcohol, pharma, lifestyle myths, anti-aging, mental health, and more

These are just examples – this journey is open-ended. I’ll also dive into controversial topics, conflicting opinions, and things we often take for granted – with curiosity and a critical eye.

The goal:
A growing collection of *real* insights – no hype, no dogma.
A living document for anyone who wants to thrive – rich or broke.
No polished influencer nonsense. Just **practical tools for a clean, doable life.**

**Disclaimer:**
This project is evolving in real time. The structure, file layout, naming conventions – all of it may change over time.
There’s no fixed roadmap yet. I'm figuring it out as I go. So expect some **breaking changes**, chaos, and spontaneous reorganization. That’s part of the process.

This isn’t a course. It’s a journey. And it’s happening in public.
