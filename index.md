# The Root

**A public health journey. From zero to real wellness. For everyone.**

I’m starting this project because I’ve decided to go *all in* on my health. No more half-measures. No more guessing. I want to understand what truly supports the human body – and what silently poisons it.
This is my open notebook. My personal “bible.” My path. And anyone can read, learn, and contribute.

I’m not an expert. I’m starting from (almost) zero. But I’ll research, question, test, and document everything along the way – clearly, honestly, and practically.

This project is **not about being perfect**. It’s not about weighing your food, buying expensive gadgets, or following strict routines. It’s about understanding what truly matters – and making real health **doable** in everyday life.
For everyone. In any context. With whatever you have.

### What you’ll find here:

* **Food:** sugar, seed oils, processed food, tap water, caffeine, supplements, fasting, real nourishment
* **Movement:** low-intensity vs. high-intensity, walking, swimming, strength, longevity > burnout
* **Mind:** light exposure, blue light, sleep, dopamine, overstimulation, digital detox
* **Body:** skincare, deodorant, sunscreen, toothpaste – without toxins or microplastics
* **Home:** cleaning products, air quality, EMFs, mold, hormone disruptors, filtered water
* **Science:** how to read studies, detect bias, understand conflicts of interest, filter wellness BS
* **Plus:** alcohol, pharma, lifestyle myths, anti-aging, mental health, and more

These are just some of the topics I’ll dive into. This journey is open-ended. I’ll also explore controversial themes, conflicting opinions, and things we often take for granted – with curiosity and a critical eye.

The goal:
A growing collection of *real* insights – no hype, no dogma.
A living document for anyone who wants to thrive – rich or broke.
No polished influencer nonsense. Just **practical tools for a clean, doable life**.
