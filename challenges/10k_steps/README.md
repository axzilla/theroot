# 10k Steps – 30 Day Challenge

## Goal:
Reset my physical and mental rhythm through daily movement — and let the rest follow naturally.

## Core Rule:
- ✅ Walk at least **10,000 steps** per day

## Supporting Habits (not enforced):
- ⏰ Wake up at **5:00 AM**
- 💤 Sleep **8+ hours**
- 🍽 **16:8 fasting** (first meal ~11am / last meal ~07pm)
- 🌞 Morning light exposure
- 🧼 No processed food
- 🧠 Log each day (in this folder)

## Why?
Walking is low-stress, sustainable, and underrated for body recomposition:  
It supports fat loss, mental clarity, and long-term consistency —  
especially when paired with 2–4 resistance workouts per week.

This is not about perfection or numbers — it’s about rhythm, presence, and real-life results.

## Tracking:
Each day is logged in its own file (`day_01.md`, `day_02.md`, ...).  
If I skip a day, I log why.

## Start Date:
